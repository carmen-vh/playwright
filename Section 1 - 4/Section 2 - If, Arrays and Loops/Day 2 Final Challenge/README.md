## instrucions for the fizzbuzz game

### Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 15 become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.


# For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:

## 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...

# With this coding exercise i have set up an array that goes from 1 to 100. what you will need to do is create a loop, that iterates through the numbers and replaces the numbers, with... 

1. fizz if it is divisible by 3
2. buzz if it is divisible by 5
3. fizzbuzz if it is divisible by 15
